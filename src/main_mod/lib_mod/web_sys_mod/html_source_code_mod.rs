/// HtmlSourceCode - type to manipulate HTML source code safer than with string functions only  
/// WARNING for HTML INJECTION!   
/// HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. HTML source code is just a text.  
/// It is easy to read, write, understand and parse.  
/// The syntax of HTML source code is similar to XML structured with elements, tags, nodes, texts, comments and attributes.  
/// The browser then transforms this HTML source code into the DOM tree and then renders that.  
/// It is very tempting to modify this source code in our application with string manipulation and then pass it to the browser.  
/// The html source code (it is just a string) that is provided by the programmer is always ok, he wants it to work properly.  
/// The BIG problem arises when we need to inject some user provided data into the HTML source code.  
/// The HTML syntax mixes instructions and data together and this creates a BIG problem.  
/// Never put user provided strings in a html source code directly, because it can contain an HTML injection attack.  
/// We need to encode all user data before putting it into the HTML source code.  
/// There are 2 types of encodings: one for attributes values and another for text nodes.  
/// We will create a new type that makes it safer and easier for the programmer to replace data in the HTML source code.
